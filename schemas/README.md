# Generated schemas

This directory contains some Typescript versions of commonly useful schemas.

They're generated using [json-schema-to-typescript](https://github.com/bcherny/json-schema-to-typescript). I haven't got this package working in Deno, so it uses yarn and node. But that's not a big deal, the resulting schemas work fine in deno.
